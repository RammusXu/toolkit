### Kubernetes - terminationGracePeriodSeconds must bigger than preStop

ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination

terminationGracePeriodSeconds = sigkill = hard kill

preStop = sigterm = soft kill

When preStop runtime is over terminationGracePeriodSeconds, pod is killed forcefully.

And Kubernetes Event is like:

```
Exec lifecycle hook ([/bin/sh -c sleep 180]) for Container "..." in Pod "..." failed - error: command '/bin/sh -c sleep 180' exited with 137: , message: ""
```
